# Modeling 

Abstract 

This paper sees the introduction of tools to model and describe the network attacks, allowing for the visualization and quantification of the threat on the blockchain. The model is used to describe the attacks. In this report we describe ways of using the model introduced and to quantify the risks of an attach by means of economic analysis.
