# Modeling 

## Abstract 

This paper sees the introduction of tools to model and describe the network attacks, allowing for the visualization and quantification of the threat on the blockchain. The model is used to describe the attacks. In this report we describe ways of using the model introduced and to quantify the risks of an attach by means of economic analysis. 

An urn contains N marbles of two possible colors. We have NB black marbles and NW white marbles, where NB+NW=N is fixed. We draw M marbles from the urn. What is the probability that all of the marbles we drew from the urn are black? What is the probability that all of the marbles are white? If 0<m<M, what is the probability that we have m black marbles and M-m white marbles?
